description: Turn an idea into a work item — interview the maintainer until the change has a scope and checkable “Done when” lines, then write work/NNNN-short-name.md. Use when the user runs /spec, or asks to write up, spec or plan a feature or change before building it.

# Write a work item

The conventions and template are in `work/README.md`; follow them exactly.

1. **Read before asking.** `work/README.md`, `work/backlog.md`, the items in
   `work/` that touch the same area, `docs/decisions.md`, the matching file
   in `.claude/rules/`, and enough of the code to know what exists. Don't ask
   what the code or docs already answer.
2. **Interview** with `AskUserQuestion`, a few questions at a time, multiple
   choice where you can offer real options (recommended one first). Cover what
   is still open of: the problem and which coaches have it, what is in and
   out of scope, what “done” looks like as checks, anything touching player
   data (the privacy rule in `CLAUDE.md` needs an explicit decision to
   widen), new migrations, new environment variables or privileged routes
   (the “why can't RLS do this?” question), the Norwegian copy, and steps
   only the maintainer can do. Stop when the answers add up to a spec —
   usually two or three rounds.
3. **Write the item.** The id is the highest `NNNN` in `work/` plus one.
   Status `spec`, or `ready` if the maintainer said to go ahead. Every
   “Done when” line must be checkable: a test, a command, a screenshot, a page
   to open. If it came from the backlog, remove that line from
   `work/backlog.md`.
4. **Decisions** the maintainer made in the interview go to
   `docs/decisions.md` under the next number, and the item lists them in
   `decisions:`. Proposals stay in the item's notes.
5. **Don't build.** End with the item's path and suggest building it in a
   fresh session (`/clear`, then “build work/NNNN”), so the build starts from
   the written spec rather than this conversation.
