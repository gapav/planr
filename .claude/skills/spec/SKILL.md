description: Turn an idea into a GitHub issue on the board — interview the maintainer until the change has a scope and checkable “Done when” lines, then create the issue. Use when the user runs /spec, or asks to write up, spec or plan a feature or change before building it.

# Spec an issue

Work is tracked as issues on the GitHub board (decision 1). An issue with the
`agent` label is built by Claude in Actions (`.github/workflows/claude.yml`),
so the issue has to stand on its own: the agent sees nothing of this
conversation.

1. **Read before asking.** Open issues in the same area
   (`gh issue list --search "…"`, or the issue named in the argument with
   `gh issue view N`), `docs/decisions.md`, the matching file in
   `.claude/rules/`, and enough of the code to know what exists. Don't ask
   what the code or docs already answer.
2. **Interview** with `AskUserQuestion`, a few questions at a time, multiple
   choice where you can offer real options (recommended one first). Cover what
   is still open of: the problem and which coaches have it, what is in and
   out of scope, what “done” looks like as checks, anything touching player
   data (the privacy rule in `CLAUDE.md` needs an explicit decision to
   widen), new migrations, new environment variables or privileged routes
   (the “why can't RLS do this?” question), the Norwegian copy, and steps
   only the maintainer can do. Stop when the answers add up to a spec —
   usually two or three rounds.
3. **Write the issue** in the shape of `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/work.yml`:
   `### Why`, `### Scope` (In / Out), `### Done when` (a `- [ ]` list),
   `### Notes` (files, edge cases, decisions cited by number). Every “Done
   when” line must be checkable: a test, a command, a screenshot, a page to
   open. Show the maintainer the title and body, then
   `gh issue create --title … --body-file …` (or `gh issue edit N` to sharpen
   an existing one). If `gh` is missing, give them the text to paste instead.
   The board adds the issue to Backlog by itself.
4. **Decisions** the maintainer made in the interview go to
   `docs/decisions.md` under the next number, and the issue cites them under
   Notes. Proposals stay in Notes.
5. **Don't build.** Ask whether to hand it to the agent: if yes,
   `gh issue edit N --add-label agent`. Otherwise suggest building it in a
   fresh session (`/clear`, then “build #N”), so the build starts from the
   written issue rather than this conversation.
